My research spans public policy, governance, public administration. My research agenda comprises three main strands: **environmental governance**, where I study how policy actors address collective action problems of learning, cooperation and bargaining over costs and benefits; **regulation**, where I study how regulators influence the policy agenda; and the **multilevel governance** system of the European Union, where I study how different governance actors (civil servants, regulators, interest groups, civil society) exploit the gaps between levels of governance to further their interests.
