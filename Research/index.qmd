My research interests span public policy, governance, public administration. 
My research agenda comprises three main strands: 

* **environmental governance**, where I study how policy actors address collective action problems of learning, cooperation and bargaining over costs and benefits; 
* **regulation**, where I study how regulators influence the policy agenda; and 
* **multilevel governance** in the European Union, where I study how different governance actors (civil servants, regulators, interest groups, civil society) exploit the gaps between levels of governance to further their interests. 

The tabs below list my publications and explain my main findings in each of these three fields.
