Hello, and welcome to my website. My name is Francesca Vantaggiato. I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Public Policy in the [Department of Political Economy](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/francesca-pia-vantaggiato) at King's College London (UK).

I study how policy actors (policy-makers, bureaucrats, stakeholders) use relationships to manage uncertainty when addressing a new policy issue, trying to influence policy formulation, and/or making decisions.

I am interested in questions concerning social processes and mechanisms, collective action and social capital. I am particularly interested in answering these questions from the perspective of bureaucrats and policy-makers. In my research, I typically rely on some mix of social network analysis, interviews, regressions and computational social science methods.
