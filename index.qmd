Hello, and welcome to my website. My name is Francesca Vantaggiato. I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Public Policy in the [Department of Political Economy](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/francesca-pia-vantaggiato) at King\'s College London (UK).

I study how policy actors (policy-makers, bureaucrats, stakeholders) use relationships to manage uncertainty when addressing a new policy issue, trying to influence policy formulation, and/or making decisions.
