Hello, and welcome to my website. My name is **Francesca Vantaggiato**. I am a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) in Public Policy in the [Department of Political Economy](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/francesca-pia-vantaggiato) at King's College London (UK).

I study how policy-makers use relationships to grapple with change and uncertainty, particularly for policy issues concerning the environment and infrastructure.

At present, my research agenda is focused on *climate adaptation* - one of the greatest challenges of our time, with profound social, political and redistributive implications - in the context of *flood risk management* in the UK.

In my research, I typically rely on some mix of social network analysis, interviews, regressions and computational social science methods.
