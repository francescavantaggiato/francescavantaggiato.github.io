Hello, and welcome to my website. My name is Francesca Vantaggiato. I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Public Policy in the [Department of Political Economy](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/francesca-pia-vantaggiato) at King\'s College London (UK).

I study how policy actors (policy-makers, bureaucrats, stakeholders) use relationships to manage uncertainty when addressing a new policy issue as they try to overcome collective action problems, influence policy formulation, and make decisions.

My research agenda comprises three main strands: **climate adaptation**, where I study how actors achieve coordination and compromise over costs and benefits; **regulation**, where I study how regulators influence the policy agenda; and the **multilevel governance** system of the European Union, where I study how different governance actors (civil servants, regulators, interest groups, civil society) exploit the gaps between levels of governance to further their interests.
