    "text": "Abstract\nThe establishment of regulatory networks is one of the distinctive phenomena of the European regulatory state. Regulatory net- works have been shaped by the constant evolution of the institutional and governance landscape associated with the completion of the single market and its regulatory harmonisation. Regulatory networks first emerged in the late 1990s as informal, voluntary networks of national regulatory authorities governing sectors of economic regulation and utilities. Seeing the potential to leverage regulatory coordination to harmonise regulation across the Member States, in the early 2000s the European Commission co-opted these informal networks, trans- forming them into European Regulatory Networks (ERNs). Typically instituted via a Commission Decision as advisory bodies to the European Commission without any administrative power, ERNs comprised representatives of national regulatory authorities for the sector in question, one from each of the Member States of the European Union (EU). Their stated purpose was to foster regulatory harmonisation via exchange of information and the facilitation of deliberation among national regulators on common standards to be adopted in their respective countries. Today, most ERNs have disappeared and evolved into European Agencies with limited but concrete rulemaking and enforcement powers on issues of European relevance. However, the informal and spontaneous networks that prepared the ground for ERNs still exist; national regulators have not disbanded them. This chapter discusses both informal regulatory networks and ERNs in an evolutionary perspective in order to understand their scope and functions, the delegation dynamics they have generated, and the substantial characteristics of regulatory collaboration.\n\n\nCitation\n@incollection{VantaggiatoDeFrancescoCh:2022,\n  author       = {Francesca Pia Vantaggiato and Fabrizio De Francesco}, \n  title        = {European Regulatory Networks},\n  booktitle    = {Elgar Encyclopedia of the European Union},\n  publisher    = {Edgward Elgar},\n  year         = {2022},\n  editor       = {Jale Tosun and Paolo Graziano},\n  chapter      = {5},\n  pages        = {45-52}\n}"

    "title": "Networking for resources: How regulators use networks to compensate for lower staff levels.",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe literature has found that regulatory networks foster exchange of information between regulators, but failed to specify the mechanism whereby regulators network for expertise. This paper posits that informal networks constitute a compensatory mechanism for lacking resources. The hypothesis guiding analysis is that lower resources (operationalised as staff resources) are associated with higher network activism (operationalised as a higher proportion of outgoing ties), particularly for regulators with intermediate levels of resources, for whom the benefits of networking are most likely to outweigh the costs. I test this hypothesis in the empirical case of European national energy regulators, using recent and original data on their bilateral collaboration ties. The results of the statistical analysis lend support to the hypothesis. The results suggest that the interdependence engendered by the European Union improves European regulatory governance by improving national regulatory practice, more than would be possible on the basis of national resources alone.\n\n\nCitation\n@article{Vantaggiato_JEPP_2019,\n    author = {Francesca Pia Vantaggiato},\n    doi = {10.1080/13501763.2018.1535611},\n    journal = {Journal of European Public Policy},\n    number = {10},\n    pages = {1540-1559},\n    publisher = {Routledge},\n    title = {Networking for resources: how regulators use networks to compensate for lower staff levels},\n    volume = {26},\n    year = {2019},\n    bdsk-url-1 = {https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2018.1535611}}\n\n}"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nEuropean Administrative Networks (EANs) are well-studied platforms of collaboration between national authorities. To understand EANs, the literature typically relies on few explanatory variables: network origins, objectives, and outputs. This external view of EANs leaves important questions unanswered, notably concerning power redistribution and regulators’ perception of EANs. This article highlights the importance of network internal structures as an explanatory variable for understanding EANs. We contend that internal structures are ‘opportunity structures’ for regulators to set agendas and share resources. We investigate the case of the European Competition Network (ECN) – a highly structured, hierarchical and formalized enforcement network – drawing on structured interviews with 15 National Competition Agencies (NCAs) carried out in 2014. We find that the ECN’s formal internal structures afford all NCAs access to the agenda, foster perceptions of effectiveness, and promote informal sharing of expertise outside the network. Future research should incorporate internal structures into analyses of administrative networks.\n\n\nKey figures in the paper\n\n\n\nFigure 1: National Competition Authorities’ assessment of opportunity structures in the ECN\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n@article{Vantaggiato_Kassim_Wright_JEPP_2021,\n    author = {Francesca Pia Vantaggiato and Hussein Kassim and Kathryn Wright},\n    doi = {10.1080/13501763.2020.1737183},\n    journal = {Journal of European Public Policy},\n    number = {4},\n    pages = {571-590},\n    publisher = {Routledge},\n    title = {Internal network structures as opportunity structures: control and effectiveness in the European Competition Network},\n    volume = {28},\n    year = {2021},\n    bdsk-url-1 = {https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2020.1737183}}"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nRegulatory authorities in the utilities sector typically employ economic evidence and analysis to make expert discretionary judgments under uncertainty. However, economic analysis does not provide clear answers regarding policy outcomes. This exposes regulators to environmental uncertainty, that is, uncertainty regarding the reactions of other actors in the institutional system to their decisions. When policy outcome and environmental uncertainty are high, discretion takes center stage. Will regulators pursue the course of action suggested by economic analysis and their expert judgment or not? What explains this choice? To answer these questions, we carry out a comparative analysis of three British regulatory authorities in the utilities sector: the Office of Communications, the Office of Gas and Electricity, and the Water Services Regulation Authority. We consider two key sectoral and organizational characteristics: the extent of market competition, and statutory discretion. We rely on interview evidence and documentary analysis and a principal–agent framework. Our analysis reveals a paradox: when environmental and policy outcome uncertainty are high, the higher the regulatory discretion, the lower the role of economic expertise in regulatory decisions. Our findings call for a normative reflection on the role of expertise in regulated sectors.\n\n\nCitation\n@article{Mantzari_Vantaggiato_LawPolicy_2020,\n    author = {Mantzari, Despoina and Vantaggiato, Francesca Pia},\n    doi = {https://doi.org/10.1111/lapo.12158},\n    journal = {Law \\& Policy},\n    number = {4},\n    pages = {382-403},\n    title = {The paradox of regulatory discretion},\n    volume = {42},\n    year = {2020},\n    bdsk-url-1 = {https://doi.org/10.1111/lapo.12158}}\n}"

    "text": "Abstract\nRegulators often play a leading role in establishing their informal networks yet regulatory networks are usually considered a second-best instrument of policy integration. They have no decision-making powers and unclear policy impact. Why then do regulators initiate networks? The article shows that regulators form networks to shift the venue of policy discussion from a formal setting, dominated by policy-makers, to an informal one, where they share agenda-setting power with their peers only. Regulators forming networks are network entrepreneurs, for whom the establishment of the network is a policy goal in itself. Bolstered by previous positive networking experiences, network entrepreneurs consider networks the best instrument for influencing policy. The article analyses the empirical case of the network of energy regulators of the Euro–Mediterranean (MedReg, established in 2006) using elite interviews with 20 stakeholders. The findings hold implications for our understanding of informal regulatory collaboration in the EU and beyond.\n\n\nCitation\n@article{Vantaggiato_JCMS_2019,\n    author = {Francesca Pia Vantaggiato},\n    doi = {10.1111/jcms.12956},\n    journal = {JCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies},\n    keywords = {regulatory networks, entrepreneurship, venue shifting, informal governance, energy},\n    number = {3},\n    pages = {654-671},\n    title = {Networks as First Best?

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nMost European Administrative Networks (EANs) have been operational for over two decades. Yet, our understanding of their evolution is limited. How do EANs evolve? I formulate two hypotheses, premised on the notion that networks help actors address collective action problems by establishing social capital, whose distribution in the network changes over time to respond to changed circumstances. Using a Bayesian network model of the structure of the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER) at two-time points (1998 and 2014), this paper shows that regulatory relationships shifted from being focused on learning to be aimed at achieving compromise in order to influence European policy-making. Rather than functional, static devices of rule harmonization, EANs are dynamic social networks that adapt to their changing environment. The paper provides a theoretical background and empirical approach to understand and analyse EANs evolution in different sectors.\n\n\nKey figures in the paper\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Bayesian ERG model of network structure 1998-2000\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Bayesian ERG model of network structure 2014-2015\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n@article{Vantaggiato_JEPP_2022,\n    author = {Francesca Pia Vantaggiato},\n    doi = {10.1080/13501763.2018.1535611},\n    journal = {Journal of European Public Policy},\n    publisher = {Routledge},\n    title = {From learning to influence: the evolution of collaboration in European Administrative Networks},\n    volume = {29},\n    number = {10},\n    pages = {1631-1655},\n    year = {2022},\n    bdsk-url-1 = {https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2022.2069843}}\n}"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe literature on transnational regulatory networks identified interdependence as their main rationale, downplaying domestic factors. Typically, relevant contributions use the word “network” only metaphorically. Yet, informal ties between regulators constitute networked structures of collaboration, which can be measured and explained. Regulators choose their frequent, regular network partners. What explains those choices? This article develops an Exponential Random Graph Model of the network of European national energy regulators to identify the drivers of informal regulatory networking. The results show that regulators tend to network with peers who regulate similarly organised market structures. Geography and European policy frameworks also play a role. Overall, the British regulator is significantly more active and influential than its peers, and a divide emerges between regulators from EU-15 and others. Therefore, formal frameworks of cooperation (i.e. a European Agency) were probably necessary to foster regulatory coordination across the EU.\n\n\nKey figure in the paper\n\n\n\nFigure 1: European energy regulators’ network structure 2014-2015\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n@article{Vantaggiato_JPP_2019,\n    author = {Francesca Pia Vantaggiato},\n    doi = {10.1017/S0143814X18000156},\n    journal = {Journal of Public Policy},\n    number = {3},\n    pages = {443--464},\n    title = {The drivers of regulatory networking: policy learning between homophily and convergence},\n    volume = {39},\n    year = {2019},\n    bdsk-url-1 = {https://doi.org/10.1017/S0143814X18000156}}\n\n}"

    "text": "Abstract\nThe European Union and the United States are paradigmatic examples of multilevel governance systems that are also regulatory states. In both settings, informal networks of regulators preceded and existed alongside supranational (federal) regulatory agencies. The literature understood their rationale as preparatory to the creation of higher level agencies. This approach, however, cannot explain why informal regulatory networks still exist, years after the establishment of higher level agencies. What explains the persistence of informal regulatory networks? The argument of this article is that in multilevel governance systems, the relationship between regulatory networks and the supranational level of governance is coevolutionary and embodies struggles for autonomy and authority: as the multilevel governance system consolidates, the character of this relationship evolves from collaborative to competitive. The argument relies on a comparative historical analysis of two voluntary networks of energy regulators from the European Union and the United States, based on 27 interviews and archival research.\n\n\nCitation\n@article{Vantaggiato_Governance_2019,\n    author = {Francesca Pia Vantaggiato},\n    doi = {10.1111/gove.12409},\n    journal = {Governance},\n    number = {1},\n    pages = {173-189},\n    title = {Regulatory relationships across levels of multilevel governance systems: From collaboration to competition},\n    volume = {33},\n    year = {2020},\n    bdsk-url-1 = {https://doi.org/10.1111/gove.12409}}\n\n}"

Yet, silos are rarely investigated theoretically or empirically. What is a silo? What are the individual and organisational factors associated with silos? We propose a functionalist approach to silo definition and identification, which links individual and organisational tasks to expected intra-organisational interactions: we operationalise silos as clusters of employees lacking communication with other parts of the organisation, and analyse civil servants and departments as bipartite networks of communication using stochastic blockmodelling. We explore the existence of silos in two European bureaucracies, which differ in mission, size and workforce composition: the European Commission and the General Secretariat of the Council. We do not find evidence of silo-isation in either bureaucracy, but rather task-based patterns of interaction. Our approach can be extended to include other theoretical perspectives, e.g., socialisation effects.\n\n\nKey figures in the paper\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Blockmodel of administrative silos in the GSC\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n@article{Vantaggiato_Kassim_Connolly_JEPP2021,\n    author = {Francesca Pia Vantaggiato and Hussein Kassim and Sara Connolly},\n    doi = {10.1080/13501763.2020.1784253},\n    journal = {Journal of European Public Policy},\n    number = {9},\n    pages = {1432-1452},\n    publisher = {Routledge},\n    title = {Breaking out of silos: explaining cross-departmental interactions in two European bureaucracies},\n    volume = {28},\n    year = {2021},\n    bdsk-url-1 = {https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2020.1784253}}\n}"

    "title": "Creating adaptive social-ecological fit: The role of regional actors in the governance of Sea-level rise adaptation in San Francisco Bay",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nSea level rise is one of the most pressing climate adaptation issues around the world. Often, coastal communities are interdependent in their exposure to sea level rise – if one builds a seawall, it will push water to another – and would benefit from a coordinated adaptive response. The literature on social-ecological systems (SES) calls for actors placed at higher levels of governance (e.g. regional government in a metropolitan area) to improve coordination between local managers by serving as brokers. However, we lack empirical insight on how higher-level actors might improve coordination in practice, and theoretical development on the implications of their intermediation. To address these gaps, we study the case of adaptation to sea level rise in the San Francisco Bay Area. We build a social-ecological network of social actors and shoreline segments using original survey data and simulated scenarios of tidal and traffic interdependencies between shoreline segments. We perform a frequency analysis of network motifs that operationalize social-ecological ‘fit’ in the context of the Bay Area. We find that regional actors and non-governmental organizations increase social-ecological fit by providing intermediation between actors who work on different shoreline segments, whether interdependent or not. This shows that these actors provide adaptive social-ecological fit, future-proofing the Bay Area to current and future climate adaptation challenges.\n\n\nKey figure from the paper\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Motif distribution (inundation matrix)\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n@article{Vantaggiatoetal:GEC23, \n  author = {Francesca Pia Vantaggiato and Mark Lubell and Michelle Hummel and Aaron C.

This paper uses item-response models to empirically analyze how actors, perceived problems, and preferred policy solutions are related in a latent “policy space”. We focus on California’s San Francisco Bay region, where in the last decade, sea-level rise emerged to become one of the most salient climate adaptation issues. We find that actors and policy preferences are arranged in a two-dimensional space, with highly engaged actors more likely to consider environmental justice and ecological aspects of sea level rise. Our findings have implications for theories of nascent subsystems within the Advocacy Coalition Framework, and for understanding how a local policy subsystem develops to address and prioritize the multi-faceted impacts of climate change.\n\n\nKey figure from the paper\n\n\n\nFigure 1: IRT policy preferences\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n@article{RPR22,\n    author = {Kyra Gmoser-Daskalakis and Tyler Scott and Mark Lubell and Francesca Pia Vantaggiato},\n    title = {At Item Response Approach to Sea Level Rise Policy Preferences in a Nascent Subsystem.},\n    journal = {Review of Policy Research},\n    volume = {Accepted/In press},\n    number = {},\n    pages = {},\n    date  = {2022},\n    publisher = {},\n    doi = {},\n    URL = {}\n}"

The literature found that actors’ perceptions of forum performance depend on both their individual characteristics (goals, expertise, resources) and forum processes (trust, learning, beliefs). However, we do not know how different combinations of actors, embodying different types of knowledge or expertise, relate to forum performance. We distinguish between policy and institutional specialization. Forum participants can be policy specialists, who are experts on the policy issue, and/or institutional specialists, who are expert of the policy process in the governance system. The former excel at problem definition and facilitation; the latter enable inclusivity. We surmise that higher proportions of specialized actors positively affect the group’s perceptions of forum performance in terms of both process and outcomes, particularly in high conflict forums. We test this claim using survey data on 55 policy forums working on adaptation to sea level rise in the San Francisco Bay Area, collected in summer 2018.

    "text": "This project investigated the impact of climate change on transportation infrastructure in California. The project examined specific transportation corridors that are impacted by sea level rise in three different areas of California - the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles County and San Diego County - in comparative perspective.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Sea level rise in San Diego County\n\n\nSea-level rise is a growing concern for coastal communities in California. Flooding and erosion, exacerbated by rising sea levels, hamper the viability of transportation and other critical infrastructure along California’s coasts and bays. Adapting transportation infrastructure to sea-level rise requires collaboration and coordination among policy stakeholders and governments at multiple geographic levels. Increasing collaboration invokes important questions about governance: What kind of governance challenges do stakeholders face in different areas? How are they trying to resolve them? What innovative solutions are emerging across the state? Most importantly, what can stakeholders from different areas learn from each others’ experiences of collaborative governance?\nWe adopted a theoretical policy learning perspective and carried out a comparative analysis of collaborative governance in areas where transportation infrastructure is expected to be most vulnerable to sea-level rise. Our initial assessment identified three focal regions: Highway 37 in the San Francisco Bay Area; the Los Angeles - San Diego railroad in San Diego County; and the Pacific Coast Highway in Los Angeles County (refining this list is part of the project).\nThe project resulted in a policy report (linked here), a workshop with stakeholders held (via zoom) in April 2021, and a presentation to transportation planners and practitioners in the podcast Planning Horizons hosted by the State of California Department of Transportation.\nThe project was financed by a grant that Mark Lubell and I received from the Institute for Transportation Studies (ITS) at UC Davis, resulting from funding provided by State of California in relation to the SB1 bill. The grant amounted to $80.000 dollars."

The module focuses on the components of environmental governance (scale, collective action, power & justice, science, and actors) and how they interact to produce solutions (or to achieve nothing) in specific cases of environmental governance processes. The module highlights the political nature of environmental governance processes and the political economy of making decisions to face the consequences of a changing climate. The key takeaway of this module is that the notion of ‘leaving the politics at the door’ is wishful thinking when discussing environmental problems and solutions, no matter how well-intentioned those who utter it may be. Soon in its fourth iteration, the module has seen student numbers grow from 25 in 2020/2021 to 133 in 2023/2024 academic year and here is a little plot to show that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI take this growing interest to show that students understand that dealing with environmental problems is an inter-disciplinary enterprise, combining politics, political economy, public policy, engineering and climate science.\n\nIn connection with this module, I have created a Shiny app that is meant as an introduction to social network analysis and the way it’s used in environmental governance studies. The app is called VisualGov and it is currently in development.\n\nThe MA level Climate policy and the energy transition module I co-convene with Tomas Maltby at King’s is a policy-focused module stemming from the realization that climate policy and energy policy are becoming the same policy topic. It was offered for the first time in 2023/2024.\n\n\nThe MA module in Comparative Public Policy is of the two compulsory modules in the MA Public Policy at the Department of Political Economy at King’s. The other compulsory module is titled The Policy Process and precedes this one. The module is conceived to provide an introduction to the study of public policy in comparative perspective, by using the methods of agreement and difference. Each annual cohort typically comprises around 70 students."

    "text": "Abstract\nNot only has the frequency and severity of flooding increased under climate change, but which communities are at-risk and how those risks are distributed within communities has changed too. This realisation points to an important interplay between exposure (risk) and social vulnerability. Who is vulnerable? Answering this question is far from straightforward as different vulnerability indicators identify different groups across different scales. This paper addresses this issue. Using the empirical case of England, the spatial distribution of flood risk at different administrative scales is analysed in relation to the Environment Agency (EA) allocation of flood funding between 2015 and 2021. We find that Upper-tier Local Authority Districts with higher levels of both flood risk and social vulnerability received more funding in the period considered. Yet, that is not the scale at which flood scheme funding decisions are made. Flood schemes are decided at the local level, but funding data for smaller administrative scales is not available. Different understandings of vulnerability, the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP), and issues around data transparency and availability in flood risk management, need to be urgently addressed.\n\n\nKey figure from the paper\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Flood spending in high risk areas and social vulnerability\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n@article{ESP24,\n    author = {Anna E.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nResearch on collaborative governance, polycentric governance, and policy networks shares the hypothesis that policy networks emerge to solve collective-action problems across multiple levels of geographic scale. Policy networks provide social capital in the form of information and trust-based relationships, which enable the involved actors to learn and cooperate to address environmental risks. We argue that policy networks in polycentric governance systems are scale dependent in both structure and function. The structure of policy networks varies across levels of geographic scale, with regional-level networks presenting more structural features that support learning and cooperation. Also, local networks are more responsive to the varying risks of sea-level rise in different localities. As policy networks scale up to higher levels of geographic scale, network structures become more homogenous, driven by the regional actors’ concern for the well-being of entire regions. Drawing from a stakeholder survey in the context of sea-level rise and climate adaptation networks in San Francisco Bay, we define networks at multiple geographic scale based on the level of policy actors’ engagement with local coastal planning units. Our social network analysis findings underscore that regional actors are crucial sources of social capital for solving climate adaptation collective-action problems and that sea-level rise vulnerability is especially associated with the emergence of bonding social capital. Environmental risk, such as sea-level rise, will urge the need for collective actions across geographic scales, and our studies suggest that regional actors can provide public good across regions and reduce the transaction costs of building policy networks between disadvantaged communities.\n\n\nKey figure from the paper\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Network size and density across scales\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n@article{Huang_Lubell_Vantaggiato_E&S_2023, \n  author = {Chien-shih Huang and Mark Lubell and Francesca Pia Vantaggiato},\n  title = {Geographic scale dependency and the structure of climate adaptation policy networks in San Francisco Bay.},\n  journal = {Ecology & Society},\n  volume = {28},\n  number = {4},\n  pages = {},\n  date  = {2023},\n  publisher = {},\n  doi = {},\n  URL = {}\n}"

This Element tackles this question by studying the governance of adaptation to sea level rise in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. Like climate mitigation, climate adaptation has public good characteristics and therefore poses collective action problems of coordination and cooperation. The Element brings together the literature on adaptation planning with the Ecology of Games framework, a theory of polycentricity combining rational choice institutionalism with social network theory, to investigate how policy actors address the collective action problems of climate adaptation: the key barriers to coordination they perceive, the collaborative relationships they form, and their assessment of the quality of the cooperation process in the policy forums they attend. Using both qualitative and quantitative data and analysis, the Element finds that polycentric governance systems can address coordination problems by fostering the emergence of leaders who reduce transaction and information costs. Polycentric systems, however, struggle to address issues of inequality and redistribution.\n\n\nKey figure from the paper\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Concern about short- and long-term consequences of SLR among policy actors in SF Bay\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n@article{Vantaggiato_Lubell_CUP_2024,\n    author = {Francesca Pia Vantaggiato and Mark Lubell},\n    journal = {Cambridge Elements in Organizational Responses to Climate Change},\n    title = {Governing climate adaptation: easier said than done.

Informal tankers operate outside the reach of the state, hence the quality and price of the services they provide and the pressure their activities inflict on water systems go largely unchecked. Informal tankers use their social relationships to manage water sources and operate like an informal network. Yet, little is known about the drivers that explain their relationships and their impact on the overall water system. We investigate these issues in the empirical case of Beirut (Lebanon) using 20 semi-structured interviews and social network analysis. We find that: cooperative and competitive relationships between tankers give rise to different network structures; the drivers of cooperation and competition are religion and seniority in the market; climate change affects informal water markets by increasing competition for wells and clients.
