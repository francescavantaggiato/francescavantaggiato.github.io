    "text": "Abstract\nThe establishment of regulatory networks is one of the distinctive phenomena of the European regulatory state. Regulatory net- works have been shaped by the constant evolution of the institutional and governance landscape associated with the completion of the single market and its regulatory harmonisation. Regulatory networks first emerged in the late 1990s as informal, voluntary networks of national regulatory authorities governing sectors of economic regulation and utilities. Seeing the potential to leverage regulatory coordination to harmonise regulation across the Member States, in the early 2000s the European Commission co-opted these informal networks, trans- forming them into European Regulatory Networks (ERNs). Typically instituted via a Commission Decision as advisory bodies to the European Commission without any administrative power, ERNs comprised representatives of national regulatory authorities for the sector in question, one from each of the Member States of the European Union (EU). Their stated purpose was to foster regulatory harmonisation via exchange of information and the facilitation of deliberation among national regulators on common standards to be adopted in their respective countries. Today, most ERNs have disappeared and evolved into European Agencies with limited but concrete rulemaking and enforcement powers on issues of European relevance. However, the informal and spontaneous networks that prepared the ground for ERNs still exist; national regulators have not disbanded them. This chapter discusses both informal regulatory networks and ERNs in an evolutionary perspective in order to understand their scope and functions, the delegation dynamics they have generated, and the substantial characteristics of regulatory collaboration.\n\n\nCitation\n@incollection{VantaggiatoDeFrancescoCh:2022,\n  author       = {Francesca Pia Vantaggiato and Fabrizio De Francesco}, \n  title        = {European Regulatory Networks},\n  booktitle    = {Elgar Encyclopedia of the European Union},\n  publisher    = {Edgward Elgar},\n  year         = {2022},\n  editor       = {Jale Tosun and Paolo Graziano},\n  chapter      = {5},\n  pages        = {45-52}\n}"

    "title": "From learning to influence: the evolution of collaboration in European Administrative Networks",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nMost European Administrative Networks (EANs) have been operational for over two decades. Yet, our understanding of their evolution is limited. How do EANs evolve? I formulate two hypotheses, premised on the notion that networks help actors address collective action problems by establishing social capital, whose distribution in the network changes over time to respond to changed circumstances. Using a Bayesian network model of the structure of the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER) at two-time points (1998 and 2014), this paper shows that regulatory relationships shifted from being focused on learning to be aimed at achieving compromise in order to influence European policy-making. Rather than functional, static devices of rule harmonization, EANs are dynamic social networks that adapt to their changing environment. The paper provides a theoretical background and empirical approach to understand and analyse EANs evolution in different sectors.\n\n\nKey figures in the paper\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Bayesian ERG model of network structure 1998-2000\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Bayesian ERG model of network structure 2014-2015\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n@article{Vantaggiato_JEPP_2022,\n    author = {Francesca Pia Vantaggiato},\n    doi = {10.1080/13501763.2018.1535611},\n    journal = {Journal of European Public Policy},\n    publisher = {Routledge},\n    title = {From learning to influence: the evolution of collaboration in European Administrative Networks},\n    volume = {29},\n    number = {10},\n    pages = {1631-1655},\n    year = {2022},\n    bdsk-url-1 = {https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2022.2069843}}\n}"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe view that silos are endemic in organisations in general and the European Civil Service in particular has become increasingly widespread. Yet, silos are rarely investigated theoretically or empirically. What is a silo? What are the individual and organisational factors associated with silos? We propose a functionalist approach to silo definition and identification, which links individual and organisational tasks to expected intra-organisational interactions: we operationalise silos as clusters of employees lacking communication with other parts of the organisation, and analyse civil servants and departments as bipartite networks of communication using stochastic blockmodelling. We explore the existence of silos in two European bureaucracies, which differ in mission, size and workforce composition: the European Commission and the General Secretariat of the Council. We do not find evidence of silo-isation in either bureaucracy, but rather task-based patterns of interaction. Our approach can be extended to include other theoretical perspectives, e.g., socialisation effects.\n\n\nKey figures in the paper\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Blockmodel of administrative silos in the GSC\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n@article{Vantaggiato_Kassim_Connolly_JEPP2021,\n    author = {Francesca Pia Vantaggiato and Hussein Kassim and Sara Connolly},\n    doi = {10.1080/13501763.2020.1784253},\n    journal = {Journal of European Public Policy},\n    number = {9},\n    pages = {1432-1452},\n    publisher = {Routledge},\n    title = {Breaking out of silos: explaining cross-departmental interactions in two European bureaucracies},\n    volume = {28},\n    year = {2021},\n    bdsk-url-1 = {https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2020.1784253}}\n}"

    "title": "Creating adaptive social-ecological fit: The role of regional actors in the governance of Sea-level rise adaptation in San Francisco Bay",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nSea level rise is one of the most pressing climate adaptation issues around the world. Often, coastal communities are interdependent in their exposure to sea level rise â if one builds a seawall, it will push water to another â and would benefit from a coordinated adaptive response. The literature on social-ecological systems (SES) calls for actors placed at higher levels of governance (e.g.Â regional government in a metropolitan area) to improve coordination between local managers by serving as brokers. However, we lack empirical insight on how higher-level actors might improve coordination in practice, and theoretical development on the implications of their intermediation. To address these gaps, we study the case of adaptation to sea level rise in the San Francisco Bay Area. We build a social-ecological network of social actors and shoreline segments using original survey data and simulated scenarios of tidal and traffic interdependencies between shoreline segments. We perform a frequency analysis of network motifs that operationalize social-ecological âfitâ in the context of the Bay Area. We find that regional actors and non-governmental organizations increase social-ecological fit by providing intermediation between actors who work on different shoreline segments, whether interdependent or not. This shows that these actors provide adaptive social-ecological fit, future-proofing the Bay Area to current and future climate adaptation challenges.\n\n\nKey figure from the paper\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Motif distribution (inundation matrix)\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n@article{Vantaggiatoetal:GEC23, \n  author = {Francesca Pia Vantaggiato and Mark Lubell and Michelle Hummel and Aaron C.

I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Public Policy in the Department of Political Economy at Kingâs College London (UK).\nI study how policy actors (policy-makers, bureaucrats, stakeholders) use relationships to manage uncertainty when addressing a new policy issue, trying to influence policy formulation, and/or making decisions.\nI am interested in questions concerning social processes and mechanisms, collective action and social capital. I am particularly interested in answering these questions from the perspective of bureaucrats and policy-makers. In my research, I typically rely on some mix of social network analysis, interviews, regressions and computational social science methods."

The module focuses on the components of environmental governance (scale, collective action, power & justice, science, and actors) and how they interact to produce solutions (or to achieve nothing) in specific cases of environmental governance processes. The module highlights the political nature of governance processes, and how the notion of âleaving the politics at the doorâ is, at best, hypocritical. Soon in its fourth iteration, the module has seen student numbers grow from 25 in 2020/2021 to 133 in 2023/2024 academic year.\n\nIn connection with this module, I have created a Shiny app that represents an introduction to social network analysis and the way itâs used in environmental governance studies. The app is called VisualGov and it is currently in development.\n\nThe MA level Climate policy and the energy transition module I co-convene with Tomas Maltby at Kingâs is a policy-focused module stemming from the realization that climate policy and energy policy are becoming the same policy topic. It will be offered for the first time in 2023/2024.\n\n\nThis is one of the two compulsory modules in the MA Public Policy at the Department of Political Economy at Kingâs. The other compulsory module is titled The Policy Process and precedes this one. The module is conceived to provide an introduction to the study of public policy in comparative perspective, by using the good olâ methods of agreement and difference."
