    "text": "Abstract\nThe establishment of regulatory networks is one of the distinctive phenomena of the European regulatory state. Regulatory net- works have been shaped by the constant evolution of the institutional and governance landscape associated with the completion of the single market and its regulatory harmonisation. Regulatory networks first emerged in the late 1990s as informal, voluntary networks of national regulatory authorities governing sectors of economic regulation and utilities. Seeing the potential to leverage regulatory coordination to harmonise regulation across the Member States, in the early 2000s the European Commission co-opted these informal networks, trans- forming them into European Regulatory Networks (ERNs). Typically instituted via a Commission Decision as advisory bodies to the European Commission without any administrative power, ERNs comprised representatives of national regulatory authorities for the sector in question, one from each of the Member States of the European Union (EU). Their stated purpose was to foster regulatory harmonisation via exchange of information and the facilitation of deliberation among national regulators on common standards to be adopted in their respective countries. Today, most ERNs have disappeared and evolved into European Agencies with limited but concrete rulemaking and enforcement powers on issues of European relevance. However, the informal and spontaneous networks that prepared the ground for ERNs still exist; national regulators have not disbanded them. This chapter discusses both informal regulatory networks and ERNs in an evolutionary perspective in order to understand their scope and functions, the delegation dynamics they have generated, and the substantial characteristics of regulatory collaboration.\n\n\nCitation\n@incollection{VantaggiatoDeFrancescoCh:2022,\n  author       = {Francesca Pia Vantaggiato and Fabrizio De Francesco}, \n  title        = {European Regulatory Networks},\n  booktitle    = {Elgar Encyclopedia of the European Union},\n  publisher    = {Edgward Elgar},\n  year         = {2022},\n  editor       = {Jale Tosun and Paolo Graziano},\n  chapter      = {5},\n  pages        = {45-52}\n}"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nRegulatory authorities in the utilities sector typically employ economic evidence and analysis to make expert discretionary judgments under uncertainty. However, economic analysis does not provide clear answers regarding policy outcomes. This exposes regulators to environmental uncertainty, that is, uncertainty regarding the reactions of other actors in the institutional system to their decisions. When policy outcome and environmental uncertainty are high, discretion takes center stage. Will regulators pursue the course of action suggested by economic analysis and their expert judgment or not? What explains this choice? To answer these questions, we carry out a comparative analysis of three British regulatory authorities in the utilities sector: the Office of Communications, the Office of Gas and Electricity, and the Water Services Regulation Authority. We consider two key sectoral and organizational characteristics: the extent of market competition, and statutory discretion. We rely on interview evidence and documentary analysis and a principal–agent framework. Our analysis reveals a paradox: when environmental and policy outcome uncertainty are high, the higher the regulatory discretion, the lower the role of economic expertise in regulatory decisions. Our findings call for a normative reflection on the role of expertise in regulated sectors.\n\n\nCitation\n@article{Mantzari_Vantaggiato_LawPolicy_2020,\n    author = {Mantzari, Despoina and Vantaggiato, Francesca Pia},\n    doi = {https://doi.org/10.1111/lapo.12158},\n    journal = {Law \\& Policy},\n    number = {4},\n    pages = {382-403},\n    title = {The paradox of regulatory discretion},\n    volume = {42},\n    year = {2020},\n    bdsk-url-1 = {https://doi.org/10.1111/lapo.12158}}\n}"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nRegulators often play a leading role in establishing their informal networks yet regulatory networks are usually considered a second-best instrument of policy integration. They have no decision-making powers and unclear policy impact. Why then do regulators initiate networks? The article shows that regulators form networks to shift the venue of policy discussion from a formal setting, dominated by policy-makers, to an informal one, where they share agenda-setting power with their peers only. Regulators forming networks are network entrepreneurs, for whom the establishment of the network is a policy goal in itself. Bolstered by previous positive networking experiences, network entrepreneurs consider networks the best instrument for influencing policy. The article analyses the empirical case of the network of energy regulators of the Euro–Mediterranean (MedReg, established in 2006) using elite interviews with 20 stakeholders. The findings hold implications for our understanding of informal regulatory collaboration in the EU and beyond.\n\n\nCitation\n@article{Vantaggiato_JCMS_2019,\n    author = {Francesca Pia Vantaggiato},\n    doi = {10.1111/jcms.12956},\n    journal = {JCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies},\n    keywords = {regulatory networks, entrepreneurship, venue shifting, informal governance, energy},\n    number = {3},\n    pages = {654-671},\n    title = {Networks as First Best?

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nMost European Administrative Networks (EANs) have been operational for over two decades. Yet, our understanding of their evolution is limited. How do EANs evolve? I formulate two hypotheses, premised on the notion that networks help actors address collective action problems by establishing social capital, whose distribution in the network changes over time to respond to changed circumstances. Using a Bayesian network model of the structure of the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER) at two-time points (1998 and 2014), this paper shows that regulatory relationships shifted from being focused on learning to be aimed at achieving compromise in order to influence European policy-making. Rather than functional, static devices of rule harmonization, EANs are dynamic social networks that adapt to their changing environment. The paper provides a theoretical background and empirical approach to understand and analyse EANs evolution in different sectors.\n\n\nKey figures in the paper\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Bayesian ERG model of network structure 1998-2000\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Bayesian ERG model of network structure 2014-2015\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n@article{Vantaggiato_JEPP_2022,\n    author = {Francesca Pia Vantaggiato},\n    doi = {10.1080/13501763.2018.1535611},\n    journal = {Journal of European Public Policy},\n    publisher = {Routledge},\n    title = {From learning to influence: the evolution of collaboration in European Administrative Networks},\n    volume = {29},\n    number = {10},\n    pages = {1631-1655},\n    year = {2022},\n    bdsk-url-1 = {https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2022.2069843}}\n}"

    "title": "The drivers of regulatory networking: policy learning between homophily and convergence.",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe literature on transnational regulatory networks identified interdependence as their main rationale, downplaying domestic factors. Typically, relevant contributions use the word “network” only metaphorically. Yet, informal ties between regulators constitute networked structures of collaboration, which can be measured and explained. Regulators choose their frequent, regular network partners. What explains those choices? This article develops an Exponential Random Graph Model of the network of European national energy regulators to identify the drivers of informal regulatory networking. The results show that regulators tend to network with peers who regulate similarly organised market structures. Geography and European policy frameworks also play a role. Overall, the British regulator is significantly more active and influential than its peers, and a divide emerges between regulators from EU-15 and others. Therefore, formal frameworks of cooperation (i.e. a European Agency) were probably necessary to foster regulatory coordination across the EU.\n\n\nKey figure in the paper\n\n\n\nFigure 1: European energy regulators’ network structure 2014-2015\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n@article{Vantaggiato_JPP_2019,\n    author = {Francesca Pia Vantaggiato},\n    doi = {10.1017/S0143814X18000156},\n    journal = {Journal of Public Policy},\n    number = {3},\n    pages = {443--464},\n    title = {The drivers of regulatory networking: policy learning between homophily and convergence},\n    volume = {39},\n    year = {2019},\n    bdsk-url-1 = {https://doi.org/10.1017/S0143814X18000156}}\n\n}"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe European Union and the United States are paradigmatic examples of multilevel governance systems that are also regulatory states. In both settings, informal networks of regulators preceded and existed alongside supranational (federal) regulatory agencies. The literature understood their rationale as preparatory to the creation of higher level agencies. This approach, however, cannot explain why informal regulatory networks still exist, years after the establishment of higher level agencies. What explains the persistence of informal regulatory networks? The argument of this article is that in multilevel governance systems, the relationship between regulatory networks and the supranational level of governance is coevolutionary and embodies struggles for autonomy and authority: as the multilevel governance system consolidates, the character of this relationship evolves from collaborative to competitive. The argument relies on a comparative historical analysis of two voluntary networks of energy regulators from the European Union and the United States, based on 27 interviews and archival research.\n\n\nCitation\n@article{Vantaggiato_Governance_2019,\n    author = {Francesca Pia Vantaggiato},\n    doi = {10.1111/gove.12409},\n    journal = {Governance},\n    number = {1},\n    pages = {173-189},\n    title = {Regulatory relationships across levels of multilevel governance systems: From collaboration to competition},\n    volume = {33},\n    year = {2020},\n    bdsk-url-1 = {https://doi.org/10.1111/gove.12409}}\n\n}"

Yet, silos are rarely investigated theoretically or empirically. What is a silo? What are the individual and organisational factors associated with silos? We propose a functionalist approach to silo definition and identification, which links individual and organisational tasks to expected intra-organisational interactions: we operationalise silos as clusters of employees lacking communication with other parts of the organisation, and analyse civil servants and departments as bipartite networks of communication using stochastic blockmodelling. We explore the existence of silos in two European bureaucracies, which differ in mission, size and workforce composition: the European Commission and the General Secretariat of the Council. We do not find evidence of silo-isation in either bureaucracy, but rather task-based patterns of interaction.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nSea level rise is one of the most pressing climate adaptation issues around the world. Often, coastal communities are interdependent in their exposure to sea level rise – if one builds a seawall, it will push water to another – and would benefit from a coordinated adaptive response. The literature on social-ecological systems (SES) calls for actors placed at higher levels of governance (e.g. regional government in a metropolitan area) to improve coordination between local managers by serving as brokers. However, we lack empirical insight on how higher-level actors might improve coordination in practice, and theoretical development on the implications of their intermediation. To address these gaps, we study the case of adaptation to sea level rise in the San Francisco Bay Area. We build a social-ecological network of social actors and shoreline segments using original survey data and simulated scenarios of tidal and traffic interdependencies between shoreline segments. We perform a frequency analysis of network motifs that operationalize social-ecological ‘fit’ in the context of the Bay Area. We find that regional actors and non-governmental organizations increase social-ecological fit by providing intermediation between actors who work on different shoreline segments, whether interdependent or not. This shows that these actors provide adaptive social-ecological fit, future-proofing the Bay Area to current and future climate adaptation challenges.\n\n\nKey figure from the paper\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Motif distribution (inundation matrix)\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n@article{Vantaggiatoetal:GEC23, \n  author = {Francesca Pia Vantaggiato and Mark Lubell and Michelle Hummel and Aaron C.

We focus on California’s San Francisco Bay region, where in the last decade, sea-level rise emerged to become one of the most salient climate adaptation issues. We find that actors and policy preferences are arranged in a two-dimensional space, with highly engaged actors more likely to consider environmental justice and ecological aspects of sea level rise.

We distinguish between policy and institutional specialization. Forum participants can be policy specialists, who are experts on the policy issue, and/or institutional specialists, who are expert of the policy process in the governance system. The former excel at problem definition and facilitation; the latter enable inclusivity.

We test this claim using survey data on 55 policy forums working on adaptation to sea level rise in the San Francisco Bay Area, collected in summer 2018.

One is adaptation to sea level rise in California, the other is the governance of flood risk management in England. I started the former as a post-doc at University of California, Davis. I started working on the latter upon joining King’s.\n\nFlood risk managementSea level rise adaptation"

    "text": "Hello, and welcome to my website. My name is Francesca Vantaggiato. I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Public Policy in the Department of Political Economy at King’s College London (UK).\nI study how policy actors (policy-makers, bureaucrats, stakeholders) use relationships to manage uncertainty when addressing a new policy issue, trying to influence policy formulation, and/or making decisions.\nI am interested in research questions concerning social processes and mechanisms, collective action and social capital. I am particularly interested in answering these questions from the perspective of bureaucrats and policy-makers. In my research, I typically rely on some mix of social network analysis, interviews, regressions and computational social science methods."

    "text": "At King’s, I teach at both undergraduate and graduate levels.\nAt undergraduate level, I teach:\n\nEnvironmental Governance for third-level undergraduate students in public policy, political economy, PPE.\n\nAt graduate level, I teach:\n\nComparative Public Policy, one of the core modules of the Masters in Public Policy\nClimate policy and the energy transition, an optional module for Masters students in Public Policy and Political Economy.\n\nIn the tabs below I summarize how I go about teaching these things.\n\nEnvironmental policy and governanceComparative Public Policy\n\n\nThe 3rd year undergraduate Environmental Governance module I teach at King’s has been the first of its kind (a module on governance, and on the environment) in the Department of Political Economy. The module focuses on the components of environmental governance (scale, collective action, power & justice, science, and actors) and how they interact to produce solutions (or to achieve nothing) in specific cases of environmental governance processes. The module highlights the political nature of governance processes, and how the notion of ‘leaving the politics at the door’ is, at best, hypocritical. Soon in its fourth iteration, the module has seen student numbers grow from 25 in 2020/2021 to 133 in 2023/2024 academic year.\n\nIn connection with this module, I have created a Shiny app that represents an introduction to social network analysis and the way it’s used in environmental governance studies. The app is called VisualGov and it is currently in development.\n\nThe MA level Climate policy and the energy transition module I co-convene with Tomas Maltby at King’s is a policy-focused module stemming from the realization that climate policy and energy policy are becoming the same policy topic. It will be offered for the first time in 2023/2024.\n\n\nThis is one of the two compulsory modules in the MA Public Policy at the Department of Political Economy at King’s. The other compulsory module is titled The Policy Process and precedes this one. The module is conceived to provide an introduction to the study of public policy in comparative perspective, by using the good ol’ methods of agreement and difference."
